          <h2>1960s</h2>
          <p>Fortran, the first high-level language began to gain popularity and marks a shift in the word of programming.
            From one of programming directly in a way for computers to understand to programming that is more readable by humans.
            As the 60s proceeded interest in programming languages grew as the most successful languages were designed by committees by people.

          <h2>1970s</h2>
          <p>As time progressed many of the debate's from the 60s continued into the 70s about the merits of "structured programming".
            Many of the most influential programming languages came from this time, even though not listed above, such as: Smalltalk, Prolog, 
            ML, and Scheme all came out of the 70s. Smalltalk's sue of object-oriented design would cause ripple effects for decades to come.

          <h2>1980s</h2>
          <p>The 80s saw evolution without as much innovation. Engineers took the ideas from the past two decades and set to refine and create
            something new. OOD's popularity began to take off with the invention of C++ and as the scale of computing began to increase.
            The 80s brought standardization and implementation throughout the computing world. The wild west land of programming languages was
            slowly being settled.

          <h2>1990s</h2>
          <p>The invention of the internet brought a new landscape for programming languages and systems. This new platform created ways for
            languages to be adopte. This effects of which can still be seen today! The decade also saw the introduction of scripting languages,
            the younger brother of programming languages, having more liberal features and more unique syntaxes.

        <h2>2000s</h2>
        <p>As the Internet progressed many of the forerunner languages from the 70s & 80s died out being replaced by languages built from their ideas.
          Object-Oriented programming has cemented itself as the king paradigm as software begins to enter the majority of industries. The importance
          of maintainability, usability, and scalability in software is paramount as programming languages enters the information era.

        <h2>2010s</h2>
        <p>The progression of the Internet began a new age of standardization as software engineers were still trying to figure out the best practices.
          Mobile devices also played a role in how programminglanguages can be used and the tools for creating mobile applications. The increased
          popularity of Artificial Intelligence helped bring Python onto the map and bring new developers to the language. Perhaps with the past decade
          of standardization a new renaissance of programming languages will soon come.
