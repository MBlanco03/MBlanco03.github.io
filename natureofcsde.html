      <p>In the span of five days in the middle of August 2019 I made a change that started me down a rabbit hole I have yet to see the end of, 
        and one that is having an overall impact on my educational career thus far. I chose to slightly alter my major from a straight computer 
        science degree to a combined degree of computer science and design. At the time I wasn’t sure what I was getting myself into 
        (and while that makes me technically half an art student) I can’t say I have any regrets to the decision. From it, I’ve become immersed 
        in a world I previously knew nothing about, and in turn my curiosity and interest in computer science has only gone up.</p>

      <p>An obvious question arises when considering the combination of a very technical major like computer science with one as abstract as 
        design: What jobs can you get? For many the answer lies in user experience, data visualizations, and other very visual 
        types of CS fields. I can definitely say my interests currently lie in Human-Computer Interaction. From the beginning I have 
        always found it interesting how we not only use all the various modern technologies that surround us, but also importantly how we 
        got to where we are now.</p>

      <p>To me it’s a mix of people and computers. Understanding how we might interact with the software and hardware in front of us, and 
          how it all works behind the scenes. Perhaps, in a way, HCI to me is a perfect blend of countless disciplines where there is always 
          something new to create or learn about. This way of thinking can be applied to more than just the basic devices around us but to other 
          fields of  computer science. Personally I find programming languages incredibly fascinating for many similar reasons. By looking at the 
          history of programming languages you can chart a path to how we ended up with the most popular languages and practices of today.</p>

      <p>In its most abstract sense I relish the “how” and “why”. How we got to where we are now, why are things done the way they are, 
        and based on that information how can it be improved going forwards? I read a quote somewhere that said “Simplicity is an art of 
        iteration” and that applies to code as much as it does to design. Improvements require looking back on the past and learning from it. 
        Maybe this is the reason I enjoy HCI. To be able to ask these abstract questions and continue to learn.</p>

      <p>Of course where does design fit into all of this? A simple answer lies in the interface of whatever is being made or anything related
        to the visuals of the project. Although other than that I believe there are some abstract ideas from design that can be applied to
         computer science to create a unique blend of these two different worlds. So far my design classes have left me looking closer at 
         the world around me attempting to understand it more. Just as I find myself staring at every logo as I walk around Boston, I can’t 
         help but take a deeper look at the various software practices and principles attempting to understand them more. There is no one all 
         encompassing definition of what design is, but it’s an area where nothing is set in stone and is always changing. Something that can be 
         very much said about software. Now with a year of coursework done so far I think I can say I made the right decision to go down this 
         unique path of computer science. I don’t know what the future will hold or how my interests may change, but for now I enjoy where the 
         road is taking.
