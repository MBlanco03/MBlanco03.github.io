                <p>An initial, and perhaps my first, exploration of form and counterform. The task was to
                    use a variety of letterforms and look at interesting aspects of a letter's form. Going a step further
                    the forms of letters could be combined to make even more interesting and unique combinations.

                <p>My final project in my Fundamentals course. In the assignment I had to choose between a list of 
                    designers and create a publication based on that designer's history and impact to the design world. 
                    The publication took the form of a foldable pamphlet to practice the different ways information can be
                    displayed.
